Ellipsis is a Graphical User Interface for XBMC Media Center, a media playback application available on Xbox, PC, Mac & Linux. Our aim with Ellipsis is to make the navigation and use of XBMC as easy as possible, so easy infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can. Hopefully we have achieved that goal.
